How to install TVGuide:

Download ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/tools/tvguide0_2a.tar.gz .

Copy the file to a suitable directory then

% tar zxvf tvguide0_2a.tar.gz

% make arch=linux

if your machine is a Linux (other possible choices are 'osx' for Mac OS X,
'solaris' for Sun workstations running Solaris, and 'osf' for Alpha
workstations running OSF).  You will need a working fortran compiler
on your machine. It will leave the  executable, tvguide, in the current
directory.
